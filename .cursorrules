  You are an expert in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Next.js App Router, Zustand, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind, and Stylus.

  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical JavaScript code following Standard.js rules.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.

  Standard.js Rules
  - Use 2 space indentation.
  - Use single quotes for strings except to avoid escaping.
  - No semicolons (unless required to disambiguate statements).
  - No unused variables.
  - Add a space after keywords.
  - Add a space before a function declaration's parentheses.
  - Always use === instead of ==.
  - Infix operators must be spaced.
  - Commas should have a space after them.
  - Keep else statements on the same line as their curly braces.
  - For multi-line if statements, use curly braces.
  - Always handle the err function parameter.
  - Use camelcase for variables and functions.
  - Use PascalCase for constructors and React components.

  Naming Conventions
  - Use camelcase for directories (e.g., components/authWizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

  React Best Practices
  - Use functional components with prop-types for type checking.
  - Use the "function" keyword for component definitions.
  - Implement hooks correctly (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback).
  - Follow the Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only call hooks from React functions).
  - Create custom hooks to extract reusable component logic.
  - Use React.memo() for component memoization when appropriate.
  - Implement useCallback for memoizing functions passed as props.
  - Use useMemo for expensive computations.
  - Avoid inline function definitions in render to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Prefer composition over inheritance.
  - Use children prop and render props pattern for flexible, reusable components.
  - Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for code splitting.
  - Use refs sparingly and mainly for DOM access.
  - Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled components.
  - Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
  - Use cleanup functions in useEffect to prevent memory leaks.
  - Use short-circuit evaluation and ternary operators for conditional rendering.

  State Management
  - Use Zustand for global state management.
  - Lift state up when needed to share state between components.
  - Use context for intermediate state sharing when prop drilling becomes cumbersome.

  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI and Radix UI for component foundations.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  - Use Stylus as CSS Modules for component-specific styles:
    - Create a .module.styl file for each component that needs custom styling.
    - Use camelCase for class names in Stylus files.
    - Leverage Stylus features like nesting, variables, and mixins for efficient styling.
  - Implement a consistent naming convention for CSS classes (e.g., BEM) within Stylus modules.
  - Use Tailwind for utility classes and rapid prototyping.
  - Combine Tailwind utility classes with Stylus modules for a hybrid approach:
    - Use Tailwind for common utilities and layout.
    - Use Stylus modules for complex, component-specific styles.
    - Never use the @apply directive

  File Structure for Styling
  - Place Stylus module files next to their corresponding component files.
  - Example structure:
    components/
      Button/
        Button.js
        Button.module.styl
      Card/
        Card.js
        Card.module.styl

  Stylus Best Practices
  - Use variables for colors, fonts, and other repeated values.
  - Create mixins for commonly used style patterns.
  - Utilize Stylus' parent selector (&) for nesting and pseudo-classes.
  - Keep specificity low by avoiding deep nesting.

  Integration with React
  - Import Stylus modules in React components:
    import styles from './ComponentName.module.styl'
  - Apply classes using the styles object:
    <div className={styles.containerClass}>

  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'useState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  - Implement route-based code splitting in Next.js.
  - Minimize the use of global styles; prefer modular, scoped styles.
  - Use PurgeCSS with Tailwind to remove unused styles in production.

  Forms and Validation
  - Use controlled components for form inputs.
  - Implement form validation (client-side and server-side).
  - Consider using libraries like react-hook-form for complex forms.
  - Use Zod or Joi for schema validation.

  Error Handling and Validation
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions.

  Accessibility (a11y)
  - Use semantic HTML elements.
  - Implement proper ARIA attributes.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation support.

  Testing
  - Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows.
  - Use snapshot testing judiciously.

  Security
  - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
  - Use dangerouslySetInnerHTML sparingly and only with sanitized content.

  Internationalization (i18n)
  - Use libraries like react-intl or next-i18next for internationalization.

  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  - Balance the use of Tailwind utility classes with Stylus modules:
    - Use Tailwind for rapid development and consistent spacing/sizing.
    - Use Stylus modules for complex, unique component styles.

  Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

# TSX Components Structure Guide

> **Purpose:** This file defines the recommended order and organization for TSX
> components in React with TypeScript. It serves as both an **AI coding guideline**
> and a **developer reference** for writing and reviewing components consistently
> across the project.

---

## Why This Structure Exists

React components can grow quickly and become hard to navigate. A consistent internal
structure means that any developer (or AI) reading the file can find what they need
predictably: types at the top, state in the middle, rendering at the bottom.
This order follows a "declare before you use" principle — everything a section depends
on is always defined above it.

---

## Alphabetical Ordering Rule

Everything that can be sorted alphabetically **must** be sorted alphabetically within
its block. This applies to:

- Enum values
- Interface and type properties
- Destructured props
- useState declarations
- useRef declarations
- useCallback declarations
- useEffect blocks (sorted by their primary dependency or action name)
- Function declarations
- Import specifiers within each import group
- Export lists

The only exception is when a declaration **depends** on another one defined in the same
block. In that case, the dependency comes first regardless of alphabetical order. This
is rare inside a single section — the structure is designed so that dependencies live
in earlier sections.

---

## Rule: TypeScript Definitions Must Live OUTSIDE the Component

**✅ DO: Define types, interfaces, and enums at module scope (above the component)**

```tsx
// ✅ Correct: defined outside, reusable and stable across renders
interface UserProps {
	name: string;
}

const User = ({ name }: UserProps) => <div>{name}</div>;
```

**❌ DON'T: Define types inside the component function body**

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong: recreated on every render, not exportable, pollutes component scope
const User = () => {
	interface UserProps {
		// Never do this
		name: string;
	}

	return <div />;
};
```

Defining types outside gives you better performance (no re-creation on each render),
reusability across components, cleaner separation of concerns, better IDE support and
IntelliSense, and the ability to export them for testing and reuse.

---

## Component Structure (Full Template)

This is the canonical order. Every section header below is a comment block you drop
into your `.tsx` file. Sections you don't need can be omitted entirely.

```tsx
/* ===== Imports ===== */
// 1. External libraries (React, third-party packages)
// 2. Redux or state management
// 3. Custom hooks
// 4. Child components
// 5. Types and interfaces (from other files)
// 6. Utils, constants, and assets
// → Within each group, sort import specifiers alphabetically

/* ===== Constants & Enums ===== */
// Enums first (they feed into types below), values sorted alphabetically
// Module-level constants sorted alphabetically (API URLs, limits, config objects, default values)

/* ===== Types & Interfaces ===== */
// Type aliases (can reference enums and constants above), properties sorted alphabetically
// Interfaces sorted alphabetically, properties sorted alphabetically
// Props interface always last (it references the types above)
// Generic types

/* ===== Component Function ===== */
// Function signature + props destructuring (alphabetical) with default values

/* ===== Redux ===== */
// useDispatch
// useSelector calls (sorted alphabetically by the state key they access)

/* ===== Hooks ===== */
// Custom hooks sorted alphabetically (e.g., useAuth, useDebounce, useFetch)

/* ===== State ===== */
// useState declarations sorted alphabetically by state variable name

/* ===== Refs ===== */
// useRef declarations sorted alphabetically

/* ===== Memos ===== */
// useMemo sorted alphabetically by variable name — derived or expensive computed values

/* ===== Derived Values ===== */
// Simple const declarations sorted alphabetically
// (no hooks — just plain const declarations computed from state/props)

/* ===== Functions ===== */
// Pure helper functions sorted alphabetically
// get[Value] for functions that return data
// render[Content] for functions that return JSX fragments

/* ===== Callbacks ===== */
// useCallback sorted alphabetically by function name
// Naming convention: handle[Action] for event handlers

/* ===== Effects ===== */
// useEffect blocks sorted alphabetically by their primary action or dependency

/* ===== JSX Return ===== */
// The component's return statement
// JSX props sorted alphabetically on each element

/* ===== Exports ===== */
// export default ComponentName
// export type { ... } sorted alphabetically
// export { ... } sorted alphabetically
```

## Section-by-Section Explanation

### Imports

Grouped by origin: external libraries first, then internal. Within each group, import
specifiers are sorted alphabetically. This makes it immediately clear what the component
depends on from outside the project vs. what comes from within.

### Constants & Enums

Enums go first because types and interfaces (in the next section) may reference them.
Enum values are sorted alphabetically. Constants like `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE` or
`MAX_RETRIES` belong here if they are reused across the file or exported, and are
sorted alphabetically among themselves. Keep configuration objects (e.g., API endpoint
maps) here as well, with their internal keys sorted alphabetically.

### Types & Interfaces

All TypeScript definitions for this file. Properties within each type or interface are
sorted alphabetically. Interfaces themselves are sorted alphabetically, with one
exception: the **Props interface is always last** — it acts as the "entry point" of the
component and often references the other types above it.

### Component Function

Just the function signature and props destructuring. Destructured props are sorted
alphabetically. Default prop values go here too. Everything else that follows is the
body of the component.

### Redux

`useDispatch` first, then selectors (`useSelector`) sorted alphabetically by the state key they read.
Keep them together because they represent the component's contract with
the global store.

### Hooks

Custom hooks that encapsulate logic, sorted alphabetically (e.g., `useAuth()`,
`useDebounce()`). These often return state or callbacks that the sections below will
consume.

### State

All `useState` declarations, sorted alphabetically by state variable name. Group
related state together and consider whether multiple pieces of state should be a single
`useReducer` instead.

### Refs

`useRef` declarations sorted alphabetically for DOM references, timers, or mutable
values that don't trigger re-renders.

### Memos

`useMemo` sorted alphabetically by variable name. Only use this when the computation is
genuinely costly or when the result is passed as a prop to a memoized child.

### Derived Values

Simple `const` declarations sorted alphabetically that derive a value from state or
props without needing `useMemo`. For example: `const fullName = \`${firstName} ${lastName}\`;`.
This is the right place for anything that's computed but doesn't need memoization.

### Functions

Pure, non-memoized helper functions sorted alphabetically. Use `get[Value]` naming for
functions that return data, and `render[Content]` naming for functions that return JSX
fragments.

### Callbacks

Memoized event handlers wrapped in `useCallback`, sorted alphabetically. Use
`handle[Action]` naming (e.g., `handleRowClick`, `handleSubmit`). These go after plain
functions because they may call them.

### Effects

`useEffect` blocks sorted alphabetically by their primary action or dependency name.
Place them last (before the return) because they run after render and often depend on
state, callbacks, or refs defined above.

### JSX Return

The component's `return (...)` statement. Props on each JSX element are sorted
alphabetically. If the JSX is complex, break it into `render[Name]` functions defined
in the Functions section above.

### Exports

Default export first, then named type exports (alphabetical), then named value exports
(alphabetical). Exporting types here makes them available for other components without
polluting the module's runtime exports.

## Naming Conventions

| Pattern           | Used For                                  | Example                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `get[Value]`      | Functions that compute and return a value | `getFilteredUsers()`             |
| `handle[Action]`  | Event handler callbacks                   | `handleRowClick`, `handleSubmit` |
| `has[Condition]`  | Boolean derived values (presence)         | `hasErrors`, `hasResults`        |
| `is[Condition]`   | Boolean derived values (state)            | `isLoading`, `isSelected`        |
| `on[Action]`      | Props that receive callback functions     | `onChange`, `onUserSelect`       |
| `render[Content]` | Functions that return a JSX fragment      | `renderUserCard(user)`           |

---

## Example: Basic Component

A straightforward component that demonstrates the core structure without Redux or
custom hooks. Every block follows alphabetical ordering.

```tsx
/* ===== Imports ===== */
import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

/* ===== Constants & Enums ===== */
enum Status {
	ERROR = 'error',
	IDLE = 'idle',
	LOADING = 'loading',
	SUCCESS = 'success',
}

const MAX_ITEMS = 100;

/* ===== Types & Interfaces ===== */
interface User {
	email: string;
	id: number;
	name: string;
	status: Status;
}

interface UserListProps {
	initialUsers: User[];
	onUserSelect: (user: User) => void;
}

/* ===== Component Function ===== */
const UserList = ({ initialUsers, onUserSelect }: UserListProps) => {
	/* ===== State ===== */
	const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState<number | null>(null);

	/* ===== Derived Values ===== */
	const activeUsers = initialUsers.filter((user) => user.status !== Status.ERROR);
	const hasUsers = activeUsers.length > 0;

	/* ===== Functions ===== */
	function renderUserCard(user: User): JSX.Element {
		return (
			<div
				className={user.id === selectedId ? 'selected' : ''}
				key={user.id}
				onClick={() => handleSelect(user)}
			>
				<span>
					{user.email}
				</span>

				<strong>
					{user.name}
				</strong>
			</div>
		);
	}

	/* ===== Callbacks ===== */
	const handleSelect = useCallback(
		(user: User) => {
			onUserSelect(user);
			setSelectedId(user.id);
		},
		[onUserSelect]
	);

	/* ===== JSX Return ===== */
	return (
		<div className="user-list">
			{hasUsers ? activeUsers.map(renderUserCard) : <p>No users available.</p>}
		</div>
	);
};

/* ===== Exports ===== */
export default UserList;
export type { User, UserListProps };
export { Status };
```

---

## Example: Complex Component

A more realistic component that uses Redux, custom hooks, refs, memos, effects, and
multiple function types — showing how all sections work together with full alphabetical
ordering applied.

```tsx
/* ===== Imports ===== */
import React, { useCallback, useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { useDebounce } from '@/hooks/useDebounce';
import { UserCard } from '@/components/UserCard';
import type { RootState } from '@/store/types';
import { fetchUsers, selectUser } from '@/store/slices/usersSlice';
import { sortByName } from '@/utils/sorting';
import { DEBOUNCE_MS, MAX_VISIBLE_USERS } from '@/constants/config';

/* ===== Constants & Enums ===== */
enum SortDirection {
	ASC = 'asc',
	DESC = 'desc',
}

const PLACEHOLDER_TEXT = 'Search users...';

/* ===== Types & Interfaces ===== */
type SortField = 'createdAt' | 'email' | 'name';

interface FilterOptions {
	search: string;
	sortDirection: SortDirection;
	sortField: SortField;
}

interface UserListPageProps {
	defaultFilter?: Partial<FilterOptions>;
	onSelectionChange?: (userId: number | null) => void;
}

/* ===== Component Function ===== */
const UserListPage = ({ defaultFilter = {}, onSelectionChange }: UserListPageProps) => {
	/* ===== Redux ===== */
	const dispatch = useDispatch();
	const isLoading = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.users.isLoading);
	const users = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.users.list);

	/* ===== Hooks ===== */
	const debouncedSearch = useDebounce(DEBOUNCE_MS);

	/* ===== State ===== */
	const [search, setSearch] = useState(defaultFilter.search ?? '');
	const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState<number | null>(null);
	const [sortDirection, setSortDirection] = useState<SortDirection>(defaultFilter.sortDirection ?? SortDirection.ASC);
	const [sortField, setSortField] = useState<SortField>(defaultFilter.sortField ?? 'name');

	/* ===== Refs ===== */
	const listContainerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
	const searchInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

	/* ===== Memos ===== */
	const filteredAndSortedUsers = useMemo(() => {
		const filtered = users.filter((user) =>
			user.name.toLowerCase().includes(search.toLowerCase())
		);

		return sortByName(filtered, sortField, sortDirection).slice(0, MAX_VISIBLE_USERS);
	}, [search, sortDirection, sortField, users]);

	/* ===== Derived Values ===== */
	const hasResults = filteredAndSortedUsers.length > 0;
	const resultCount = filteredAndSortedUsers.length;

	/* ===== Functions ===== */
	function getEmptyMessage(): string {
		return search.length > 0 ? `No users match "${search}".` : 'No users available yet.';
	}

	function renderUserCard(user: { email: string; id: number; name: string }): JSX.Element {
		return (
			<UserCard
				isSelected={user.id === selectedId}
				key={user.id}
				onSelect={() => handleSelect(user.id)}
				user={user}
			/>
		);
	}

	/* ===== Callbacks ===== */
	const handleSearchChange = useCallback(
		(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
			const value = e.target.value;

			debouncedSearch(value);
			setSearch(value);
		},
		[debouncedSearch]
	);

	const handleSelect = useCallback(
		(userId: number) => {
			dispatch(selectUser(userId));
			onSelectionChange?.(userId);
			setSelectedId(userId);
		},
		[dispatch, onSelectionChange]
	);

	const handleSortToggle = useCallback(() => {
		setSortDirection((prev) =>
			prev === SortDirection.ASC ? SortDirection.DESC : SortDirection.ASC
		);
	}, []);

	/* ===== Effects ===== */
	useEffect(() => {
		searchInputRef.current?.focus();
	}, []);

	useEffect(() => {
		dispatch(fetchUsers());
	}, [dispatch]);

	useEffect(() => {
		onSelectionChange?.(selectedId);
	}, [onSelectionChange, selectedId]);

	/* ===== JSX Return ===== */
	return (
		<div className="user-list-page">
			<div className="controls">
				<input
					onChange={handleSearchChange}
					placeholder={PLACEHOLDER_TEXT}
					ref={searchInputRef}
					type="text"
					value={search}
				/>

				<button onClick={handleSortToggle}>
					Sort: {sortField} ({sortDirection})
				</button>
			</div>

			<p className="result-count">
				{isLoading ? 'Loading...' : `${resultCount} result(s)`}
			</p>

			<div className="user-list" ref={listContainerRef}>
				{hasResults ? (
					filteredAndSortedUsers.map(renderUserCard)
				) : (
					<p>{getEmptyMessage()}</p>
				)}
			</div>
		</div>
	);
};

/* ===== Exports ===== */
export default UserListPage;
export type { FilterOptions, SortField, UserListPageProps };
export { SortDirection };
```

## Quick Reference Card

Use this as a checklist when writing or reviewing a component:

```
✅ Are all types/interfaces defined OUTSIDE the component?
✅ Is the Props interface the LAST interface in the Types section?
✅ Are imports grouped: external → internal hooks → components → types → utils?
✅ Are import specifiers sorted alphabetically within each group?
✅ Do enums come before the types that use them? Are enum values alphabetical?
✅ Are interface/type properties sorted alphabetically?
✅ Are destructured props sorted alphabetically?
✅ Are useState, useRef, useCallback, and useMemo sorted alphabetically?
✅ Are useEffect deps arrays sorted alphabetically?
✅ Are JSX props sorted alphabetically on each element?
✅ Are export lists sorted alphabetically?
✅ Is state declared before derived values that depend on it?
✅ Are effects placed after callbacks and functions they depend on?
✅ Are function names following: get[Value], render[Content], handle[Action]?
```
